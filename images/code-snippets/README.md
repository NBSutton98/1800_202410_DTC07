## Putting It All Together
You can integrate these functionalities into a single HTML file. Each section can be enclosed in a <div> to maintain organization. Remember to include Bootstrap CSS and JS in your project.

## Next Steps
Backend Integration: For user account management, group management, and persistent data storage, youâ€™ll need a backend (Node.js, Django, etc.) and a database (MongoDB, MySQL, etc.).
Styling and Responsiveness: Customize Bootstrap styles and ensure everything looks good on mobile devices.
